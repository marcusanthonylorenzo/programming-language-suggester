# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### By _**Marcus Padilla**_

#### _A simple, clean, and - most importantly - fun little webpage which could help you decide which programming language to learn, and learn some things about yourself._

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* JQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* VSCode

## Description

_First time making a modal - it was a random decision within the first hour. I created a casual questionnaire that helped me practice conditional statements and input values from radio buttons. Hopefully, I formatted the "inner HTML" properties ".html()" correctly. Also will slowly improve my README from next week._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download and install Git Bash (Windows), use the terminal in your text editor, or open Terminal(Mac).
* Open Git Bash or Terminal and type:
 **cd ~/desktop**
* This will bring you to your desktop location on the command line, to receive files.
* Next, type: **git clone https://github.com/marcusanthonylorenzo/programming-language-suggester**
* Once completed, type **cd programming-language-suggester**
* On the new line, type **code .** or open in any text editor. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Once your text editor is open, access "index.html" via live server or manually with your browser.
